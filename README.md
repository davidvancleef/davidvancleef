## Aloha! 👋

I am a Software Engineer with a degree in **Computer Science from UFG**, currently pursuing a **postgraduate degree in Software Architecture and Development**, with a focus on **Design Patterns**.

I am especially interested in:

- 📊 Data Analysis  
- ⚙️ Back-end Development  
- 🔌 API Design and Integration  

I enjoy challenging situations in programming that require critical thinking, an analytical perspective, and, above all, creativity to solve them. Therefore, whenever possible, I try to solve problems using methods that others haven't yet considered.
