## Aloha! 👋

I'm a Brazilian Software Engineer with a degree in **Computer Science from UFG**, currently pursuing a **postgraduate degree in Software Architecture and Development**, with a focus on **Design Patterns**.

I am especially interested in areas such as **Data Analysis, Back-end Development, and API Design and Integration**.

I enjoy challenging programming situations that require critical thinking, an analytical mindset, and, above all, creativity to solve problems. Whenever possible, I try to approach challenges using methods that others haven't yet considered.
